A Data Analysis project to determine the best times for internet usage by analyzing the log file provided by the user.

# User story

Aravind while using mobile data noticed he was facing major network fluctuations and hence wants to identify the best and worst time during a day for best internet usage based on various factors as mentioned [here](Task.md). Analyse the log file given to better understand the situation and apply data science skills to clean, model and analyse the data to provide him answers to the questions asked in later sections of this [document](Task.md).
